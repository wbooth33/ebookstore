# ebookstore
A small Python program which uses SQLite3 module to create a database to store books. An updated version witha simple GUI made with Tkinter is also accessible on the master branch of this page.

When first running the program it will attempt to create a database to store the information for the books, if a database already exist it will inform the user so.

Then the user will be presented with a small menu of options:

Whichever option is chosen will then call a predefined function to commit whatever information to the database. For example, choosing option 1 - Add a Book!
